# Hi there, I'm Tomas Aguinaga 👋

🏔️ **Climbing Mountains, Building Teams, Embracing the Journey**

I'm a software engineer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Since I was 18, I've been on a journey through code, teams, and challenges big enough to feel like an adventure. Now at 25, I still seek out projects that are ambitious—where the path is as rewarding as the summit.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

- **The Mountain:** I love objectives that are big, bold, and require real effort—like climbing a mountain. The journey matters as much as the destination.
- **The Team:** Great things are built together. I thrive in teams where collaboration, trust, and shared goals turn challenges into achievements.
- **The Code:** I enjoy crafting solutions in Rust 🦀, Python 🐍, and JavaScript/TypeScript ⚡—always learning, always improving.

## 🌎 About Me

- 🏠 Based in Buenos Aires, Argentina
- 👨‍💻 Programming since 18, working professionally since then
- 🧗‍♂️ Passionate about journeys—both in code and in life
