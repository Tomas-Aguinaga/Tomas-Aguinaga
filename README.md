### Hi there! ğŸ‘‹

I'm a Full stack engineer from Argentina. There is always something new to learn, so that's why I am passionate about programming.

- ğŸ’ª My main stack is React.js - Node.js, Go and Postgresql.
- ğŸŒ± But now I'm working with the entire ecosystem of React (Redux, Gatsby) and other great stuff like GraphQL, Mobx, etc.
- ğŸ‘¯ I like to help people who are starting into the development world.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want.

You can read more about me in my [website](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-aguinaga-482036187/).
